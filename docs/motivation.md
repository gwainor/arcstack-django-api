# Motivation

There are many API frameworks that designed for Django like
[Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/),
[Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/), and [tastypie](https://tastypieapi.org/).
You can find many more with a little search on Google.

All the API frameworks out there, either have high learning curve, complex
built-in systems or different usage than what you used to do with Django views
and urls. What if you just want something just simple with powerful
extensibility? This is where ArcStack Django API comes in.

It has the same powerful middleware system as Django with some API specific
tweaks. Without any middleware, the `Endpoint` class works just like `View`
class of Django.
